  <summary>This report contains some parts which consist of the following: ...</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>New Year Honours: Honours have been awarded at New Year since at least 1890, in which year a list of Queen Victoria's awards was published by the London Gazette on 2 January.</li>

    <li>Birthday Honours: Birthday Honours are part of the celebration of the reigning monarch's official birthday in each realm. The awards are presented by the reigning monarch or head of state, currently Queen Elizabeth II, or her deputy.

  Known as Queen's Birthday Honours (and King's Birthday Honours in times of a male monarch), all royal honours are published in the London Gazette, Canada Gazette, Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and New Zealand Gazette. The lists are also published in the daily newspapers of each realm.

  Honours have been awarded on the monarch's birthday since at least 9 November 1901, the birthday of King Edward VII (r. 1901–1910).[3][4] After 1908 the monarch's official birthday was moved to the first, second or third Saturday in June (for the UK). Other Commonwealth realms celebrate the official birthday on different dates (generally late May or early June), and release their honours lists accordingly.</li></ul>
  <p>There are also other hounours available, that are not part of the data set:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Australia Day Honours: The Australia Day honours were established in 1975 to replace the New Year honours in Australia. The list is issued on 26 January every year.</li>

   <li>Prime Minister's Resignation Honours: Honours granted at the behest of an outgoing Prime Minister following his or her resignation. In such a list, a Prime Minister may ask the monarch to bestow peerages, or other lesser honours, on any number of people of his or her choosing.</li>
